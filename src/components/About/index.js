                    Hi, My name is Vitor Bigelli. Enthusiast of Artificial Intelligence and passionated about learning and teaching, I believe in technology as the tool to build a better world.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I started my professional development at ETEC de Itanha√©m, where I obtained a technical degree in Internet Informatics at the age of 17, learning programming logic and the basic concepts behind web applications.
                    <br/><br/>
                    My focus changed when I started a graduation in Materials Engineer at UTFPR, guided for my mathematical passion and ease in the field. Inside the university, I developed two projects directed to teaching basic informatics and programming logic using Java.
                    <br/><br/>
                    By the end of 2017 I started to study programming again, this time focusing on front-end development.
                    <br/><br/>
                    From 2019 to 2021 I worked at Nindoo AI, as Full-Stack Developer and R&D Scientist with focus on delivering technologies to solve real world problems. Today I'm a Software Engineer at Well Well, where we are developing a product to revolutionize the way that people see preventive medicine and their well-being.
