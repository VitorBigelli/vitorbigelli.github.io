                    Enthusiast of Artificial Intelligence and passionate about learning and teaching, I believe in technology as the tool to build a better world.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I started my professional development at ETEC de Itanha√©m, where I obtained a technical degree in Internet Informatics at the age of 17, learning programming logic and the basic concepts behind web applications.
                    <br/><br/>
                    My focus changed when I started a graduation in Materials Engineer at UTFPR, guided for my mathematical passion and ease in the field. Inside the university, I developed two projects directed to teaching basic informatics and programming logic using Java.
                    <br/><br/>
                    4 years ago I started to study programming again, this time focusing on front-end development.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Today, I work at Nindoo AI, as Full-Stack Developer and R&D Scientist with focus on delivering technologies to solve real world problems.
